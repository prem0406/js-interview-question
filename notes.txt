ES6 FEATURES
------------

let and const

Template literals ``

Spread operator [..arr]

SET: new Set();  unique values

Generator function:

Block-Scope support for both variables, constants, functions

Arrow functions: => don't change context (value of 'this' will not changes )

Extented Parameter Handling

Enhanced Regular functions

Enhanced Object Properties

Destructuring Assingnments: 

Spread, Rest:

Iterators:

MODULES: Intead of putting all the code in one file, distribute the code in
        different files called modules. Name export and default export can
        be done.

Classes: Blue print of object

    class Person {

        constructor(name){
            this.name = name;
        }

        walk() {
            console.log('can walk')
        }
    }

    const new = new Person("Prem");

Map/Set & WeakMap/WeakSet

Promises, Meta-Programming, Internationalization and localization

BABEL: transpiles ES6 code to its lower versions.

WEBPACK: is open source JS module bundler that takes modules with 
        dependencies and generates static asses representing those
        modules.
        -It bundles multiples modules and pack it into a sing js files
        -comes with integrated dev server
        It allows you to run an environment that host bable

DEBOUCING AND THROTTLING
------------------------

Performance optimization

You can limit the rate of call of expesive funtion.

Throttling:
                Throttling is used to call a function after every millisecond or 
                a particular interval of time only the first click is executed immediately.


Deboucing:       Debouncing is a programming practice used to ensure that time-consuming 
                tasks do not fire so often, that it stalls the performance of the web page. 
                 In other words, it limits the rate at which a function gets invoked.
